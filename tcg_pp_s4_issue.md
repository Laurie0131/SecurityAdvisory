# 21. TCG PP S4 issue

## Description:

TCG physical presence will record TCG PP flag \(if user confirmation is required\) to a variable `(TCG2_PHYSICAL_PRESENCE_FLAGS_VARIABLE/gEfiTcg2PhysicalPresenceGuid)`. This variable is locked by `EDKII_VARIABLE_LOCK_PROTOCOL`.  
In S4 resume path, the code `Tcg2PhysicalPresenceLibProcessRequest` finds it is S4 resume and return immediately. It does not call `EDKII_VARIABLE_LOCK_PROTOCOL` to lock the variable `(TCG2_PHYSICAL_PRESENCE_FLAGS_VARIABLE/ gEfiTcg2PhysicalPresenceGuid)`.

## Recommendation:

We need update `Tcg2PhysicalPresenceLibProcessRequest` to move S4 check AFTER variable lock.  
This is addressed by EDK2 GIT 7b9b576c71c71ed134f50497fd58f862109dd80b.
